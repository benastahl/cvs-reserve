# CVS Vaccine Reserve

### __The script only works with PFIZER (not Moderna or J&J).__

> `cvs-main-localhost.py` works with your local ip. If you abuse the CVS API, you may have your IP permanently banned.

When the script is started, you will be asked for a `location` and a `radius`. These two inputs will be used to search for your vaccine. 

For `location`, you do not need to input an address perfectly, you can input a zip code, address, (town, state), etc. The script will use CVS's API to search around your location for CVS locations that are giving out vaccinations.

You need to input your information in `patient_info.py` and input your discord webhook into `general_info.py` (or leave field blank).
